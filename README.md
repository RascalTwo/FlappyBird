## Gameplay

Your goal is to fly for as long a possible.

Crashing into the floor, pipes, or flying into spaces will cause you to stop flying.

Previous games can be saved both so you can save them to watch layer, and so you can play the same level again.

> Flying over snow indicates you are currently setting a high score!

## Controls

- Space or Mouse click increases your height
